# latlon2map

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `latlon2map` is to make it simple to process spatial data, and to match tabular data distributed in spreadsheets with longitude/latitude columns with various geographical units based on shapefile distributed by statistical offices such as Eurostat. 

The package includes a number of convenience functions that download and cache locally pre-processed files to reduce boilerplate code commonly found in data projects, hopefully speeding up the data pipeline and favouring reproducibility.

By dafault, `latlon2map` stores all downloaded files in the current working directory. However, it makes is easy to keep them on a single folder, preventing the common issue of having multiple copies of the same geographic files for each data project on a computer. The code remains transferrable and reproducible, as missing files are simply downloaded on the fly if unavaiable locally.

## Installation

You can install `latlon2map` from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("giocomai/latlon2map")
```

## Use

All `latlon2map` function starts with `ll_` to facilitate auto-completion. By default, data are stored in a folder called `ll_data` inside the working directory. However, I suggest caching data in a separate folder for system-wide caching: you will not need to re-download again geographic files for different projects, and you will not unncessarily sync multiple copies of those files for each project that needs them. You need to call e.g. `ll_set_folder("~/R/")` once per session. Given that you may well download big files that take longer than the 60 seconds to download, you are advised to set a reasonably high timeout for downloads at the beginning of each session.

```{r}
library("latlon2map")
ll_set_folder(fs::path(fs::path_home_r(), "R"))
options(timeout = 6000)
```


There are currently a number of functions facilitating downloads of geographic datasets, mostly from Eurostat's website. They all return `sf` objects, all of them transformed to crs 4326, all of them keeping all of the columns present in the original dataset. Future versions will likely add standard-named columns to facilitate matching data between different datasets.

For reference all of the original data are kept in the `ll_data/shp/` folder, so it is possible to check metadata about each dataset. Information on copyright is printed to the console each time a given data source is used.

Functions calls such as `ll_get_world(resolution = 60)` can safely be used where you would usually place your `sf` object/data frame. They will download items when they are not locally available, and will simply load pre-processed data on the following calls.

Check the package vignette for more details, examples, and use cases. 

## Shiny app

The package includes a shiny app that facilitates matching latitude/longitude data frames wtih geographic units. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ll_app()
```
